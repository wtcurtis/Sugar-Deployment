Couple of very simple scripts for developing directly on the server.\nauto_install is copied wholesale from ... someone on the Sugar forums, don't recall.\nauto_uninstall was modified from that, after a quick reading of the package manager code for the available functions.\ndeploy.php is probably the least generally useful, but I got tired of zipping, copying, pasting, installing, deleting.
