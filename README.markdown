Couple of very simple scripts for developing directly on the server.

**auto_install.php** is copied wholesale from ... someone on the Sugar forums, don't recall.

**auto_uninstall.php** was modified from that, after a quick reading of the package manager code for the available functions.

**deploy.php** is probably the least generally useful, but I got tired of zipping, copying, pasting, installing, deleting. Will require direct modification, and it should be a shell script rather than a php script, but eh.
